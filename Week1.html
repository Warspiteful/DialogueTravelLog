        <h2>Day 1 - 6/1/20</h2>
            <img src="./Resources/Images/Week1/Ogham.png" class = "start" style = "display: inline-block;"><p class = "entry">Starting the day was an introduction to the Ogham Alphabet, an early medieval alphabet read bottom to top. We were tasked with writing our own name and one of <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Seven Principles of Peace</span>: Love, Faith, Hope, Unity, Courage, Justice, and Forgiveness.
            <br><br>For me, the letter "J" doesn't exist in the alphabet so I instead used the symbol for "G". Thus, my name was written as Gustin. I picked the word "Love" to write out as well. The reason why the letters are in line left-to-right was because we weren't sure what direction it was supposed to be read in when we were writing, so I just did the most intuitive style. </p> <img src="./Resources/Images/Week1/Writing.jpg" class = "side" style = "display: inline-block;"> 
            <br>
            <p class = "entry">Following the activity, we delved deep into the timeline regarding the history of the native Tuatha culture. For example, it was mentioned that the Tuatha operated as a confederation, which made the island vulnerable to invasion but never truly conquerable. However, what was most interesting was the arrival of Christianty and how it was adapted into the indigenous culture. The actual religion was readily integrated into Ireland, one of the few examples of bloodless evangelization. This was chiefly due to the parallels that existed between the native Irish tradition and Christianity. What came out was a uniquely Irish version of Catholicism, where monastic tradition (centered on places/community) rather than episcopal (centered on people/hierarchy). Interestingly enough, monasteries took the role as not only the religious center, but also the municipal center as well. Following in the line of the Irish obsession of learning, it also became essentially a secular center for learning native Tuatha tradition and go to for scholarly teachings.</p>
            <br>
            <p class ="entry"> We ended the day talking about Brig and her Christian counterpart, St. Brighid. The Irish goddess Brig was the goddess of fertility, spring, and healing as well as the patron of smiths and pregnant women, emerging as the exalted one following the domination of warrior gods in the Irish mythological landscape. With the arrival of Christianity, Jesus and the holy trinity usurped Brig's role and became the sole author of life; Mary would also step in to become the feminine icon of the church. However, Brig still remained in the minds of the ordinary folk and there is the idea that St. Brighid was created to become that link between the old pagan religion and the new Christianity. This is most obvious when looking at St. Brighid's day, which falls on Imbolc, an Irish celebration of the start of Spring also called Brigid's Day</p>

        <h2 >Day 2 - 6/2/20</h2>
                
            <p class = "entry">Today, more than any other day, was an exploration of the history of Irish culture, and how it shifted and changed as time passed and colonization came and went. To help us on this journey, we had the opportunity to have Irish historian <a href = "https://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/e-ociardha">Eamonn O Ciardha</a> as a guest.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "entry">Eamonn is a Gaeilgeoir, which is a term that describes a native Irish speaker. The speaking of the Irish language is somewhat controversial, a result of the colonization that Ireland experienced under Britain. We watched a TED talk from one Gaeilgeoir named Donal o Healai, who described being scared of and embarrassed of his Irish heritage in his youth. However, the Irish language, Healai explained, is a beautiful language that deserves to rise back to prominence; he sang the Lament of the Three Marys as an example of how the language can seemingly materialize the feeling of grief into words in a way few others can.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "entry">One of the most noteworthy and interesting ideas discussed today was the concept of a palimpset. A palimpset is a piece of manuscript "on which the original writing has been effaced to make room for later writing but of which traces remain." Thanks to the rule of the British, Ireland contains numerous examples of palimpsets in its very landscape. Places of religious value, such as the Hill of Tara, were co-opted by catholics during the land's Christianization, essentially layering their own significance over the pre-existing native ideas. Another, more abstract, example is the very names in Ireland. Due to British rule, a lot of the traditional Irish names have become anglicized. This is shown in both structure names, landmark names, and the names of people. </p>

    <h2 >Day 3 - 6/3/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">Stories play a major role in our lives, sometimes warning us about dangers, inspiring us to be better, or reminding us where we came from and where we can go. The discussion about stories that defined us was how we started the day, and my story was the story of the Philippines and the struggle against the Marcos Regime. The story is a stark reminder that the United States, which supported the dictatorial Marcos due to his anti-communist stance, is not all benevolent and perfect. It is a reminder that student activism can prevail against even those unafraid to turn the military against their own people for the sake of power, but it is also a reminder that a population scorned can still forget what pains it endured to welcome it back again.</p>
        <br>
        <p class ="entry">Today's guest was Austin McTiernan, a tour guide for Carrowmore Megalithic Cemetery. While we used Google Maps to explore the Irish landscape, the most interesting part of the day was learning about the stories of Ireland. One such story was the story of the Cailleach, known as the harbinger of winter. She does battle with the harbinger of spring and alter ego, Brighid, to determine the season. However, the most interesting group of stories discussed is that of the four cycles, each of the four stories playing a major part of the Irish mythology. Of the four cycles, the two that were explored were the Ulster Cycle and the Fenian cycle. </p>
        <br>
        <p class ="entry">The Ulster Cycle tells the story of Queen Maeve of Connacht and the Ulster warrior Cú Chulainn as told in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Queen Maeve was said to have grown jealous her spouse, Ailill, and his white cow Finnbennach. She resolve to find her own cow, which led her to the cow Donn Cúailnge. The cow belonged to Dáire mac Fiachna, who was happy to loan it to the queen. However, the soldiers of Queen Maeve, having become drunk during the celebrations, revealed that they would have taken the cow by force if they refused. The clan took exception to that, and kicked out the soldiers. This led Queen Maeve to order a raid on the town of Cooley, where the family lived. Due to the curse of Ulster that weakened the land's men during invasions, only one soldier could defend the land: Cú Chulainn. As a result of his heroics, he would become the archetype of the warrior in Irish lore.</p>

        <h2 >Day 4 - 6/4/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">Today's class was a movie day, where we briefly discussed illuminated manuscripts and then watched the Secret of the Kells. The Secret of the Kells tells the story of the Kells Abbey, an Irish monastery during the times of the Norman invasion, and a famous illuminated manuscript known as the Book of Kells. The story also involves another famous Irish motif, the Aisling, who acts as a guide in the forest. </p>

    <div id = "day5" class = "day5">
        <h2 >Day 5 - 6/5/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">The topic of race, no matter where it comes up, is always such a difficult topic to face. However, it was imperative to discuss it when it came to Ireland. Ireland was subject to colonization and its people were beaten down, but it is not the same typical imagery that comes with a lot of colonial stories. It is true that these were indigenous people but looking at the result in modern times, the people of Ireland have become folded into the idea of the "white" race. Unlike many of the natives of other colonized places, they have seemingly joined the "club" of the colonizers by being accepted as being white by society. However, Ireland was undeniably hurt. It's people may now be thought of to have the same skin color as their oppressors, but the power dynamic was so painfully visible. </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry">The Irish may be "white" in skin, but they were not the "white" of the colonizers. Nothing made this more clear than the Statutes of Kilkenny, which was created to assert English control over the island. It drew the line between Irish and British, segregating their churches, marriages, and even their languages. The emergence of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants), also known as the Protestant Ascendency, furthered this power divide. The irish may be white, but to think of them as simply another European country like France or Britain is doing a great disservice to the history of the island and the struggles that its people endured under British rule. The idea of "whiteness" blinds the eye from the division that was so harshly enforced, and steals away the uniquely Irish identity that has slowly come to light.</p>

        <h2 >Day 6 - 6/6/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">Ireland is quite famous for its music, made famous for its river songs and jig tunes. However, our guests Edel Ní Churraoin and Diane Cannon helps shed light on some typically overlooked parts of the culture. What came as a surprise was that Irish music was typically passed down orally and thus, was never written down. It wasn't until the Irish came to America was the first music book created and in fact Ireland's first music recording, which was used for radios and the like, was imported from America.</p>
        <p class = "entry">The Irish are typically known for their dancing, but Irish singing can be just as equally remarkable if not more. Diane was an example of a Sean-nós singer, a type of singing defined as a "highly ornamented style of unaccompanied traditional Irish singing, and in the singing of Ireland's Gaeltacht." We got a taste of the music with a song called "Oró mo bhaidín".</p>
