    <h2>Day 1 - 6/1/20</h2>
        <img src="./Resources/Images/Week1/Ogham.png" class = "start" style = "display: inline-block;"><p class = "entry">Starting the day was an introduction to the Ogham Alphabet, an early medieval alphabet read bottom to top. We were tasked with writing our own name and one of <span style = "font-weight: bold;">Seven Principles of Peace</span>: Love, Faith, Hope, Unity, Courage, Justice, and Forgiveness.
        <br><br>For me, the letter "J" doesn't exist in the alphabet so I instead used the symbol for "G". Thus, my name was written as Gustin. I picked the word "Love" to write out as well. The reason why the letters are in line left-to-right was because we weren't sure what direction it was supposed to be read in when we were writing, so I just did the most intuitive style. </p> <img src="./Resources/Images/Week1/Writing.jpg" class = "side" style = "display: inline-block;"> 
        <br>
        <p class = "entry">Following the activity, we delved deep into the timeline regarding the history of the native Tuatha culture. For example, it was mentioned that the Tuatha operated as a confederation, which made the island vulnerable to invasion but never truly conquerable. However, what was most interesting was the arrival of Christianty and how it was adapted into the indigenous culture. The actual religion was readily integrated into Ireland, one of the few examples of bloodless evangelization. This was chiefly due to the parallels that existed between the native Irish tradition and Christianity. What came out was a uniquely Irish version of Catholicism, where monastic tradition (centered on places/community) rather than episcopal (centered on people/hierarchy). Interestingly enough, monasteries took the role as not only the religious center, but also the municipal center as well. Following in the line of the Irish obsession of learning, it also became essentially a secular center for learning native Tuatha tradition and go to for scholarly teachings.</p>

        <p class ="entry"> We ended the day talking about Brig and her Christian counterpart, St. Brighid. The Irish goddess Brig was the goddess of fertility, spring, and healing as well as the patron of smiths and pregnant women, emerging as the exalted one following the domination of warrior gods in the Irish mythological landscape. With the arrival of Christianity, Jesus and the holy trinity usurped Brig's role and became the sole author of life; Mary would also step in to become the feminine icon of the church. However, Brig still remained in the minds of the ordinary folk and there is the idea that St. Brighid was created to become that link between the old pagan religion and the new Christianity. This is most obvious when looking at St. Brighid's day, which falls on Imbolc, an Irish celebration of the start of Spring also called Brigid's Day</p>
    <h2>Day 2 - 6/2/20</h2>
    <p class = "entry">Today, more than any other day, was an exploration of the history of Irish culture, and how it shifted and changed as time passed and colonization came and went. To help us on this journey, we had the opportunity to have Irish historian <a href = "https://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/e-ociardha">Eamonn O Ciardha</a> as a guest.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "entry">Eamonn is a Gaeilgeoir, which is a term that describes a native Irish speaker. The speaking of the Irish language is somewhat controversial, a result of the colonization that Ireland experienced under Britain. We watched a TED talk from one Gaeilgeoir named Donal o Healai, who described being scared of and embarrassed of his Irish heritage in his youth. However, the Irish language, Healai explained, is a beautiful language that deserves to rise back to prominence; he sang the Lament of the Three Marys as an example of how the language can seemingly materialize the feeling of grief into words in a way few others can.</p>
