        <h2>Day 1 - 6/9/20</h2>
          <p class = "entry">Today's class served as a general overview for many of the aspects involved in the 1900-2000 Ireland. We started the day off with guest Sionnán Ní Nualláín, a storyteller. She told us several stories, such as the Children of Lir, and gave us resources for looking into Irish lore. Following that, Professor MacDonald talked about the history of Ireland, as well as the conflicts that plagued the division with Northern Ireland. One major part of this was the comparisons drawn between the resolution in South Africa with the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the peace sought after in Ireland. </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">We also went into detail about some of the conflicts present in the history of Ireland. For example, it was mentioned that during the Tudor Conquest, the famed victory of William of Orange on July 12, 1690, took place. We also talked about the Cromwellian period, where 1/4 of the Catholic population (1 million out of 4 million) perished. We also discussed the 1800s and lead ups to the Easter Rising, such as the Act of Union, the Great Hunger, and the establishment of both the IRB and Fenian Brotherhood. </p>

        <h2 >Day 2 - 6/10/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">As with poems and stories, music can play an important role in the art of storytelling. None know this better than guest Damien Dempsey, a famed Irish singer who puts the history of the island at the heart of his songs. During class, he showed off a couple of his songs such as "James Connolly", a song that celebrates the titular man who helped lead the 1916 Easter Rising and advocated for change in Ireland.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry"> Beyond simply his music, Dempsey holds his Irish identity close to his heart. During class, we discussed the division between Ireland and Northern Ireland and how religion was simply a cover for the true cause: British imperialism. One such occurrence was with the story of James Larkin. In Wales, Larkin helped organize labor strikes to advocate for a better wage, even convincing some police sent to shut down the strikes to instead join his cause. However, the movement was shattered when the Prince of Wales intentionally sowed ethnic tensions, preventing the middle-class from uniting.</p>
