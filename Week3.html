        <h2>Day 1 - 6/5/20</h2>
          <p class = "entry">Today's class served as a general overview for many of the aspects involved in the 1900-2000 Ireland. We started the day off with guest Sionnán Ní Nualláín, a storyteller. She told us several stories, such as the Children of Lir, and gave us resources for looking into Irish lore. Following that, Professor MacDonald talked about the history of Ireland, as well as the conflicts that plagued the division with Northern Ireland. One major part of this was the comparisons drawn between the resolution in South Africa with the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the peace sought after in Ireland. </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">We also went into detail about some of the conflicts present in the history of Ireland. For example, it was mentioned that during the Tudor Conquest, the famed victory of William of Orange on July 12, 1690, took place. We also talked about the Cromwellian period, where 1/4 of the Catholic population (1 million out of 4 million) perished. We also discussed the 1800s and lead ups to the Easter Rising, such as the Act of Union, the Great Hunger, and the establishment of both the IRB and Fenian Brotherhood. </p>

        <h2 >Day 2 - 6/16/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">As with poems and stories, music can play an important role in the art of storytelling. None know this better than guest Damien Dempsey, a famed Irish singer who puts the history of the island at the heart of his songs. During class, he showed off a couple of his songs such as "James Connolly", a song that celebrates the titular man who helped lead the 1916 Easter Rising and advocated for change in Ireland.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry"> Beyond simply his music, Dempsey holds his Irish identity close to his heart. During class, we discussed the division between Ireland and Northern Ireland and how religion was simply a cover for the true cause: British imperialism. One such occurrence was with the story of James Larkin. In Wales, Larkin helped organize labor strikes to advocate for a better wage, even convincing some police sent to shut down the strikes to instead join his cause. However, the movement was shattered when the Prince of Wales intentionally sowed ethnic tensions, preventing the middle-class from uniting.</p>

    <div id = "day3" class = "day3">
        <h2 >Day 3 - 6/17/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">As we emerge from the 1800s and early 1900s, we must reckon with that reality that modernity did not provide an escape for pain and suffering on the island of Ireland. The emergence of The Troubles, a time period that has so larrgely shaped the world consciousness and dialogue about the partition of Ireland caused countless deaths and incredible suffering for everyone. This was true for both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, where flaring tensions gave quick rise to conflict. No event makes that more clear than the those that transpired on a day in 1972 dubbed Bloody Sunday. </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry">In the period prior to the fateful day, Great Britain began a practice of interning suspected IRA members and sympathisizes in the wake of attacks. These internments were not only conducted without trial, but were often done indiscriminately, arresting even some loyalists. Much of the population took great exception to this haphazard and unjust practice and, led by Protestant Parliament MP Ivan Cooper, began a push for civil rights through marches. In the city of Derry, the British quickly outlawed marches of any kind and took up a strict military response.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry">On the 30th of January, 1972, Ivan Cooper and over 10,000 Northern Irelanders, despite the ban, marched. Authorities had relented and outlined a permitted path that would keep the march in the Catholic area. During the march, however, some ended up splitting off and began throwing rocks at the soldiers at the barricades blocking the roads. Paratroopers from the 1st Para were spotted over the wall of a derelict building, attracting the ire of the crowd and rocks. In response, rubber bullets and tear gas were allowed to be used. As the crowd scattered and simmered, the soldiers suddenly opened fire. As the crowd ran, the paratroopers chased them down into Roseville street and the Bogside. As the paratroopers started to seize marchers and chase more down, more shots were fired by the soldiers. By the end, 26 people were shot and 13 died that day. It served as a dark reminder of British violence, causing a large uptick in IRA sign-ups in the days that followed.
