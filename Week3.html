        <h2>Day 1 - 6/5/20</h2>
          <p class = "entry">Today's class served as a general overview for many of the aspects involved in the 1900-2000 Ireland. We started the day off with guest Sionnán Ní Nualláín, a storyteller. She told us several stories, such as the Children of Lir, and gave us resources for looking into Irish lore. Following that, Professor MacDonald talked about the history of Ireland, as well as the conflicts that plagued the division with Northern Ireland. One major part of this was the comparisons drawn between the resolution in South Africa with the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the peace sought after in Ireland. </p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">We also went into detail about some of the conflicts present in the history of Ireland. For example, it was mentioned that during the Tudor Conquest, the famed victory of William of Orange on July 12, 1690, took place. We also talked about the Cromwellian period, where 1/4 of the Catholic population (1 million out of 4 million) perished. We also discussed the 1800s and lead ups to the Easter Rising, such as the Act of Union, the Great Hunger, and the establishment of both the IRB and Fenian Brotherhood. </p>

        <h2 >Day 2 - 6/16/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">As with poems and stories, music can play an important role in the art of storytelling. None know this better than guest Damien Dempsey, a famed Irish singer who puts the history of the island at the heart of his songs. During class, he showed off a couple of his songs such as "James Connolly", a song that celebrates the titular man who helped lead the 1916 Easter Rising and advocated for change in Ireland.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry"> Beyond simply his music, Dempsey holds his Irish identity close to his heart. During class, we discussed the division between Ireland and Northern Ireland and how religion was simply a cover for the true cause: British imperialism. One such occurrence was with the story of James Larkin. In Wales, Larkin helped organize labor strikes to advocate for a better wage, even convincing some police sent to shut down the strikes to instead join his cause. However, the movement was shattered when the Prince of Wales intentionally sowed ethnic tensions, preventing the middle-class from uniting.</p>
    </div>
    <div id = "day3" class = "day3">
        <h2 >Day 3 - 6/17/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">As we emerge from the 1800s and early 1900s, we must reckon with that reality that modernity did not provide an escape for pain and suffering on the island of Ireland. The emergence of The Troubles, a time period that has so larrgely shaped the world consciousness and dialogue about the partition of Ireland caused countless deaths and incredible suffering for everyone. This was true for both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, where flaring tensions gave quick rise to conflict. No event makes that more clear than the those that transpired on a day in 1972 dubbed Bloody Sunday. </p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry">In the period prior to the fateful day, Great Britain began a practice of interning suspected IRA members and sympathizers in the wake of attacks. These internments were not only conducted without trial, but were often done indiscriminately. Much of the population took great exception to this haphazard and unjust practice and, led by Protestant Parliament MP Ivan Cooper, began a push for civil rights through marches. In the city of Derry, the British quickly outlawed marches of any kind and took up a strict military response.</p>
        <br>
        <p class = "entry">On the 30th of January, 1972, Ivan Cooper and over 10,000 Northern Irelanders, despite the ban, marched. Authorities had relented and outlined a permitted path that would keep the march in the Catholic area. During the march, however, some ended up splitting off and began throwing rocks at the soldiers at the barricades blocking the roads. Paratroopers from the 1st Para were spotted over the wall of a derelict building, attracting the ire of the crowd and rocks. In response, rubber bullets and tear gas were allowed to be used. As the crowd scattered and simmered, the soldiers suddenly opened fire. As the crowd ran, the paratroopers chased them down into Roseville street and the Bogside. As the paratroopers started to seize marchers and chase more down, more shots were fired by the soldiers. By the end, 26 people were shot and 13 died that day. It served as a dark reminder of British violence, causing a large uptick in IRA sign-ups in the days that followed.

        <h2 >Day 4 - 6/18/20</h2>
        <p class  = "entry">The Troubles, a period known for its violence and upheaval, tells the story of the back-and-forth battle for the Irish soul, each side never letting the other get ahead. In today's class, we learned many of the major milestones in the period known as "The Troubles" as well as the overarching battles, waged both with guns and spirit. </p>
        <p class = "entry">One of the major incidents we examine today is known as the Battle of the Bogside. This event, which would end with riots and burning across the nation, started with the march of an organization known as the Apprentice Boys (the youth branch of the Orange Order) that celebrated the Siege of Derry. In anger, a number of catholics started to throw rocks at the marchers, kicking off the conflict. Police quickly got involved but took the side of the Unionist marchers, allowing them to attack the crowd wantonly while beating down the nationalist catholics. This battle would see the first use of tear gas on a civilian population in the UK and the erection of barricades in Free Derry that would turn the community into a no-go zone for the police. Across the country, sympathetic riots took place while protestant mobs retaliated. By the end of the Battle, Bombay Street was burned down and the sparks for the start of the new IRA were lit.</p>
        <h3>“You have this cyclical appearance of the Irish struggle for freedom. At times there is a constitutional movement; then they weary of it because you cannot accomplish very much by talking peacefully. When they weary of constitutionalism, then there is an outbreak of violence. At times we wander about in such matters as civil rights, civil liberties, and so on. But all of these I insist are side issues, really. You have the old racial colonial struggle going on, and this is the key to the whole problem.” - Eddie McAteer</h3>

      <h2 >Day 5 - 6/19/20</h2>
      <p class = "entry">Cad é mar atá tu? Maith? Dona? Meseara? That's Irish for How are you and good, bad, and meh. Learning Irish was what started our day, which would explore even more of The Troubles. Today's guest was Tony Doherty, an Irish author who was involved in IRA activities and had firsthand experience with British imprisonment. With his help, we focused mainly on the struggles of prisoners and the fight for the Five Demands.</p>
      <p class = "entry">With Tony, we learned about the the Long Kesh, also known as the Maze and the H Block, and the struggles that many of its prisoners experienced. Tony also discussed his role after his stay, where he began tackling community campaigns for justice for the events of Bloody Sunday. Our focus, however, would stay within the walls of the Long Kesh as we started watching a movie named "Hunger" from 2008. This movie tells the story of the IRA hunger strikes, an effort would ultimately result in 10 deaths before any sign of capitulation. Using long camera shots and minimal dialogue, the movie instead lets the visceral action and sounds take center stage, bringing to life the grimy and brutal experiences of the prisoners and especially Bobby Sands, the first man to give his life for the nationalist cause. To say it was a heavy experience to behold would be putting it lightly.</p>

      <h2 >Day 6 - 6/20/20</h2>
      <p class = "entry">As we've seen from Damien Dempsey, the arts play an important role in Irish culture. Irish dance such as river dancing have become known around the world, epitomized the beauty and elegance present in the culture while Irish jigs have become a distinctive and recognizable sound in popular culture. Arts are a lighter topic than the rest of the topics covered this week, but they are a welcome break from the grueling and bleak recount of Ireland's darkest times and a reminder that Ireland still stands proudly.</p>
      <p class = "entry">Guiding us through our adventure into Irish dance and music was today's guest, Liz Doherty. We learned about a number of different instruments like the tin whistle, harp, and accordions and watched a number of videos of performers (found in the linked Padlet). To top it off, Dohertyg ave us a performance accompanied by her family: her two children were on tin whistles, while her husband was on the bodhran drum.</p>
