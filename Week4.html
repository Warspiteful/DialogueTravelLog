        <h2>Day 1 - 6/22/20</h2>
          <p class = "entry">Today served as a general overview of the late period of The Troubles, at times overwhelming with its information. What our talk with guest Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh cenetered around was mostly the political upeheaval as grassroot movements emerged, complicating the IRA vs UDA dichotomy that served as an easy simplification of the Northern Ireland landscape. The IRA, while becoming one of the most sophisticated guerilla forces, also ended up being involved in a lot more issues than its leadership first expected. The war they would fight woud no longer be just with weapons; this was now a war of words.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">As the conflict became more political in nature, the Sinn Fein became of increasing relevance. The Sinn Fein were the political arm of the IRA and ran on a platform of abstentionism, that is to mean that they refused to take their seat if they won. Instead, it would sit vacant. As the Sinn Fein became more prominent, a tactic of integrating political actions and physical force emerged from the IRA dubbed the ‘armalite and ballot box strategy.’ With this success and the emergence of powerful civil rights campaigns, the Sinn Fein ended up dropping their abstentionism platform for all but Westminster seats in 1985. However, not everything would go the way of the nationalists. Reverend Ian Paisley would emerge as one of the most influential figures in Northern Ireland's history, one of the founding members of the Democratic Unionist Party. His voice would be one of the strongest voices against the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, which sought to allow the Republic of Ireland to have input in Northern Ireland. It was strongly disliked by both sides, but Paisley is well-rembered for his "Never! Never! Never!" speech.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">With the class wrapping up soon, we finished today's overview on the beginning of the peace talks that signal the ending, but not itself the end, of The Troubles. In 1994, a ceasefire is announced where all parties were meant to meet to negotiate for peace. The unionists, however, refuse to allow the Sinn Fein to sit until the IRA was decomissioned. In 1996, the ceasefire was broken by the Canary Wharf Bombing, an event that would signal that there was still more to the story of The Troubles.</p>
