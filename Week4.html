        <h2>Day 1 - 6/22/20</h2>
          <p class = "entry">Today served as a general overview of the late period of The Troubles, at times overwhelming with its information. What our talk with guest Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh cenetered around was mostly the political upeheaval as grassroot movements emerged, complicating the IRA vs UDA dichotomy that served as an easy simplification of the Northern Ireland landscape. The IRA, while becoming one of the most sophisticated guerilla forces, also ended up being involved in a lot more issues than its leadership first expected. The war they would fight woud no longer be just with weapons; this was now a war of words.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">As the conflict became more political in nature, the Sinn Fein became of increasing relevance. The Sinn Fein were the political arm of the IRA and ran on a platform of abstentionism, that is to mean that they refused to take their seat if they won. Instead, it would sit vacant. As the Sinn Fein became more prominent, a tactic of integrating political actions and physical force emerged from the IRA dubbed the ‘armalite and ballot box strategy.’ With this success and the emergence of powerful civil rights campaigns, the Sinn Fein ended up dropping their abstentionism platform for all but Westminster seats in 1985. However, not everything would go the way of the nationalists. Reverend Ian Paisley would emerge as one of the most influential figures in Northern Ireland's history, one of the founding members of the Democratic Unionist Party. His voice would be one of the strongest voices against the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, which sought to allow the Republic of Ireland to have input in Northern Ireland. It was strongly disliked by both sides, but Paisley is well-rembered for his "Never! Never! Never!" speech.</p>
          <br>
          <p class = "entry">With the class wrapping up soon, we finished today's overview on the beginning of the peace talks that signal the ending, but not itself the end, of The Troubles. In 1994, a ceasefire is announced where all parties were meant to meet to negotiate for peace. The unionists, however, refuse to allow the Sinn Fein to sit until the IRA was decomissioned. In 1996, the ceasefire was broken by the Canary Wharf Bombing, an event that would signal that there was still more to the story of The Troubles.</p>

        <h2 >Day 2 - 6/23/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">At the heart of this class is really on word, prominently displayed in the title of the Dialogue: Storytelling. We've experienced storytelling through the medium of singing, dancing, and writing, but today introduced another method that North Ireland has found to express itself: performance. This is the purpose of the Playhouse Theater of Witness, where programs allow for the telling of stories carried in secret for so long. As part of our introduction to the program, we got to meet Anne Walker, Robin Young, Elaine Forde, with Ailin Conant and Damien Gorman joining us later. </p>
        <p class ="entry">One of the biggest parts of today was learning about the relationship between formerly antagonistic communities and people in the wake of The Troubles as people work to come together. Nothing was part of this dynamic more than the connection between Anne Walker and Robin Young. Anne was a Catholic, but her family was very loyally British and were part of the Royal Air Force. However, this all changed in the wake of Bloody Sunday, when her family left the RAF for the Bogside and Anne joined the IRA. Meanwhile, Robin Young was on the opposite side of the conflict as part of the RUC. He witnessed first-hand how brutal The Troubles were as part of the body recovery team, an experience that scarred him and left with him PTSD. However, Robin expressed how this experience also empowered him to start looking for ways to prevent the tragedies he witnessed from occurring. While these two were essentially enemies during The Troubles, it was in the Playhouse that they, and everyone else involved, could talk to each other and listen to peoples' stories without prejudice. The Playhouse, after all, was not about any individual person, but about sharing truth. </p>

    <div id = "day3" class = "day3">
        <h2 >Day 3 - 6/24/20</h2>
        <p class = "entry">As we learn about the events of The Troubles, it can be so easy to forget that these events are not just ancient history. Less than fifty years ago was the start of the conflict, less than a generation ago, and it was only 22 years ago that it ended. Still, it came to a surprise to us to have the opportunity to talk to Laurence McKeown, the 11th man scheduled to die in the 1981 hunger strike that claimed the lives of the 10 men before him. In the current day, he uses his experience as a prisoner to write a number of plays, films, and books including his Phd Thesis titled "Unrepentant Fenian Bastards: The Social Construction of an Irish Republican Prisoner Community." His goal as a writer is to not to necessarily challenge the master narrative, but simply maintain the stories of the people during The Troubles so that everyone has a chance to be heard. Goals like these are vital because when the master narrative prevents official truth and reconciliation, it's necessary to find your own way of coming to terms with it all.</p>
        <p class = "entry">Another person we met whose story is deeply connected to The Troubles was John Finucane. His father and famed criminal defence lawyer, Pat Finucane, was murdered in his home by loyalist paramilitaries who acted, by British government admittance, in collusion with British government intelligence service MI5. Ever since that day, John started a campaign of justice that ultimately helped to not only reveal the existence of British collusion but make the British admit to it. Currently, John serves as a member of Parliament with the Sinn Féin party.</p>

        <p class  = "entry">Northern Ireland, for so long, has been under British control. However, the Irish spirit has seemingly become a flame that can not be put out, burning brightly and proudly despite certain attempts to put it back in the box from olden times.</p>
